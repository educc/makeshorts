I want to create 1 clip for youtube shorts, you must read the examples/video.srt to create a short maximum 60 seconds. This is the planning:

1. First read examples/video.srt to understand about the video content.
2. The clip goal is when the first winner appears and the host is verifying if the winner meet the rules. You must select carefully different segments of the video.srt to make a clip with the most interesting parts.
3. Carefully select differents segments of the video align of the clip goal, each segment is a line of the video.srt, the complete clip must be compose using different segments. The complete segment makes sense.
4. Read the README.md to understand how to use the make_shorts.py cli tool.
5. Create a bash script that contains how to create the clip using make_shorts.py, this script support multiple segments according to the docs README.md
6. This bash script make use make_shorts.py using video.mp4 and only use the output param --output 
7. You must carefully select the name of the file for the short in spanish.
