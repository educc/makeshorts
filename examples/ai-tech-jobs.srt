00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,100
 Today on Forbes, you're not imagining it, AI is already taking tech jobs.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,100
 Between meetings in April, Misha Kaufman, CEO of the freelance marketplace Fiverr, fired

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,800
 off a memo to his 1,200 employees that didn't mince words, writing, quote, "AI is coming

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
 for your jobs.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,080
 Heck, it's coming for my job, too.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
 This is a wake-up call."

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,360
 The memo detailed Kaufman's thesis for AI, that it would elevate everyone's abilities,

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,720
 easy tasks would become no-brainers, hard tasks would become easy, impossible tasks

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,080
 would become merely hard, he posited.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,720
 And because AI tools are free to use, no one has an advantage.

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,360
 In the shuffle, people who didn't adapt would be, quote, "doomed."

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,640
 Kaufman tells Forbes now, quote, "I hear the conversation around the office.

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,040
 I hear developers ask each other, 'Guys, are we going to have a job in two years?'

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,680
 I felt like this needed validation from me, that they aren't imagining stuff."

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,840
 Already, younger and more inexperienced programmers are seeing a drop in employment rate.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,840
 Ruoyu Chen, a postdoctoral fellow at the Digital Economy Lab of Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,920
 AI, said that the total number of employed entry-level developers from ages 18 to 25

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,840
 has dropped, quote, "slightly" since 2022, after the launch of ChatGPT.

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,760
 It isn't just lack of experience that could make getting a job extremely difficult going

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
 forward.

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,960
 Chen notes, too, that the market may be tougher for those who are just average at their jobs.

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,320
 In the age of AI, only exceptional employees have an edge.

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,640
 Chen and her colleagues studied large-scale payroll data in the U.S., shared by the HR

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,120
 company ADP, to examine generative AI's impact on the workforce.

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,600
 The employment rate decline for entry-level developers is small, but a significant development

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,280
 in the field of engineering in the tech industry, an occupation that has seemed synonymous with

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,100
 wealth and exorbitant salaries for more than a quarter century.

28
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,000
 Now, suddenly, after years of rhetoric about how AI will augment workers rather than replace

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,160
 them, many tech CEOs have become more direct about the toll of AI.

30
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,720
 Anthropic CEO Dario Amadei has said AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,760
 jobs and spike unemployment up to 20% within the next five years.

32
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,640
 Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last month that AI will "reduce our total corporate workforce"

33
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,400
 over the next few years as the company begins to "need fewer people doing some of the jobs

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,400
 that are being done today and more people doing other types of jobs."

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,400
 Earlier this year, Shopify CEO Toby Lutka also posted a memo that he sent his team, saying

36
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,600
 that budget for new hires would only be granted for jobs that can't be automated by AI.

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,160
 Tech companies have also started cutting jobs or freezing hiring explicitly due to AI and

38
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
 automation.

39
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,380
 At stalwart IBM, hundreds of human resources employees were replaced by AI in May, part

40
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,760
 of broader job cuts that terminated 8,000 employees.

41
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,320
 Also in May, Luis Van Ahn, CEO of the language learning app Duolingo, said the company would

42
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,840
 stop using contractors for work that could be done by AI.

43
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,440
 Sebastian Simietkowski, CEO of buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, said in May that the company

44
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,280
 had slashed its workforce 40% in part due to investments in AI.

45
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,120
 Microsoft made its own waves earlier this month when it laid off 9,000 employees, or

46
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,560
 about 4% of its workforce.

47
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,280
 The company didn't explicitly cite AI as a reason for the downsizing, but it has broadly

48
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,920
 increased its spending in AI and touted the savings it had racked up from using the tech.

49
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,000
 CEO Satya Nadella said in April that as much as 30% of code at the company is being written

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,880
 by AI.

51
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,280
 One laid-off Microsoft employee told Forbes, "This is what happens when a company is rearranging

52
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,800
 priorities."

53
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,560
 It's difficult to pinpoint the exact motivation behind job cuts at any given company.

54
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,080
 The overall economic environment could also be a factor, marked by uncertainties heightened

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,760
 by President Donald Trump's erratic tariff plans.

56
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,200
 Many companies also became bloated during the pandemic, and recent layoffs could still

57
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,000
 be trying to correct for over-hiring.
